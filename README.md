## What's this?
AntiPython Colab is a source to source compiler that let's you **build AI in Java, Rust, JavaScript, Flutter, C#, Go, Ocaml(and etc...)** utilizing free Google Colab GPUs!

It's blazingly fast and very robust as it uses websockets and the Treesitter C library under the hood.

‚úî Web GUI for ease of access

‚úî No language lock-in! Free and opensource language servers available!

‚úî Super secure language servers running on your personal device.


### Motivation
AI is super interesting but Python is a bore. We built a compiler that translates programming languages to Python!

AntiPython Colab is built for:

-   Programmers interested in free GPU access and AI - just without the Python.
-   Developers keen on accessing Python's *vast AI tooling* without touching Python. 
-   Companies that seek to add AI to their products without needing to hire Python devs.
-   Hobbyists who realize they spend more time setting up Python environments than actual coding.

## Development Status!
